node-flocking is a Node.js module for Flocking (flockingjs.org). It's a very early work in progress, but it has been tested to work on both Mac OS X and on Debian Linux running on a Raspberry Pi.

Steps to run:
-------------

Flocking in Node.js is still very raw, so the installation process is a bit awkward. There are two ways to get it up and running; this process will be significantly simplified as the codebase stabilizes.

### By hand:
1. Build [cubeb](https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb)
2. Clone node-flocking
3. Clone [flocking](https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking) into node-flocking: "git clone git://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking.git flocking"
4. Check out the infusion branch of flocking: "git checkout infusion" 
5. Install node module dependencies: "npm install cubeb dsp"
6. Test it with "node index.js"

### With npm:
1. Build [cubeb](https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb)
2. Install node-flocking via npm from the repo: "npm install git://github.com/colinbdclark/node-flocking.git"
3. Clone [flocking](https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking) into node_modules/node-flocking: "git clone git://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking.git flocking"
4. Check out the infusion branch of flocking "git checkout infusion"
5. Test it with "node index.js"
